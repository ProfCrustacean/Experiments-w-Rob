# Agent Docs Conventions

Owner: quality-tooling-owner

## Formatting Rules

- Prefer short files with one clear job.
- Keep code paths in backticks.
- Keep command examples copy-ready.
- Avoid narrative repetition across docs.

## Ownership

- Each task/module/map doc must include `Owner: <key>`.
- Allowed keys are defined in `docs/agents/maps/ownership-map.md`.

## Verification

- Task and module cards must include `Last Verified` section.
- Refresh verification when behavior or interfaces change.
